# ***Picaso*** 

Picaso is an image gallery app that fetches images from the Unsplash API. This project was built for learning purposes and incorporates the latest technologies.

***Technologies***

`React.js`
`TailwindCSS`
`Unsplash API`

***Process***

I began this project by setting up with create-react-app. I installed Tailwind CSS and router, along with Axios for API interaction. Then, I created an API using the Unsplash platform and utilized Context API for state management.

***What I Learned***

Throughout this project, I gained valuable skills and a deeper understanding of Context API and React. Additionally, I used TailwindCSS for styling the elements.

***Key Learnings***:
Utilizing createContext Hook
Understanding React Hooks and Rendering

***How can it be improved?***
To enhance the project, one could consider using different Unsplash APIs to create a collection of pictures.
